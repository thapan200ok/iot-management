# Iot Management

Created using Clean Architecture template. This is just a starting point for the project. As we develop,
we will add more features and functionality.

This project will add following features:

2. Device Authentication: Securely verify devices when they connect to the system.

3. Device Configuration: Enable configuration of device settings and parameters.

4. Device Monitoring: Track the real-time status and health of each device.

5. Alerts & Notifications: Send alerts for device malfunctions, errors, or status changes.

6. Firmware Management: Manage and deploy firmware updates to devices remotely.

7. Data Collection & Storage: Gather and store data generated by devices for analysis.

8. Analytics & Reporting: Generate reports and insights from device data to support decision-making.

9. User Management: Manage user roles, permissions, and access to different parts of the system.

10. Device Grouping: Organize devices into groups for easier management and reporting.

11. Security & Encryption: Ensure all device data and communications are encrypted and secure.

12. Integration with Other Systems: Integrate with existing enterprise software or third-party platforms.

13. Device Control: Remotely control or adjust device settings as needed.

14. Scalability: Ensure the system can handle a growing number of devices without performance issues.

15. Maintenance Scheduling: Set up regular maintenance schedules for devices and system components.

16. Audit Logs: Track all actions taken on the system for accountability and troubleshooting.

17. Geo-location Tracking: Track and visualize the locations of IoT devices on a map.

18. API Access: Provide API for third-party integrations or external access to device data.

19. Multi-platform Support: Ensure the application works across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

20. Data Backup & Recovery: Provide backup solutions to prevent data loss and support disaster recovery.

## Build

Run `dotnet build -tl` to build the solution.

## Run

To run the web application:

```bash
cd .\src\Web\
dotnet watch run
```

Navigate to https://localhost:5001. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Styles & Formatting

The template includes [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) support to help maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The **.editorconfig** file defines the coding styles applicable to this solution.

## Code Scaffolding

The template includes support to scaffold new commands and queries.

Start in the `.\src\Application\` folder.


## Test

The solution contains unit, integration, functional, and acceptance tests.

To run the unit, integration, and functional tests (excluding acceptance tests):
```bash
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~AcceptanceTests"
```

To run the acceptance tests, first start the application:

```bash
cd .\src\Web\
dotnet run
```

Then, in a new console, run the tests:
```bash
cd .\src\Web\
dotnet test
```
